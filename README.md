### What is MyTalk

<i>MyTalk</i> is a Prolog tool for NLP, based on WordNet lexical database, for the English language. It is an extension of the <i>Talk</i> program, presented in (Pereira and Shieber, 1987). First of all, just as <i>Talk</i>, <i>MyTalk</i> is able to:
<ul>
  <li>perform the syntactic parsing of a declarative sentence or of a query, returning as result the corresponding logical form (FOL);</li>
  <li>transform the obtained logical form into a Horn clause (if possible)</li>
  <li>add the clause to the Prolog database (declarative sentence) or obtain the response to the query</li>
</ul>

In addition, MyTalk:
 <ul>
  <li>performs a morphological analysis of the words, based on the ProNTo_Morph tool, which checks the concordance in number between subject and verb of a sentence;</li>
  <li>instead of using a fixed lexicon cabled within the program, it uses the portuguese lexical database to check if a word exists;</li>
  <li>supports the usage of common nouns as subjects and is able to handle a wider range of input assertions and queries. It is also able to transform a wider range of FOLs into Horn clauses.

</ul>

The access to WordNet is partially inspired to the files defined by the WordNet integration ProNTo tool, which was an useful source of inspiration.

### How to use MyTalk

This program was tested using SWI-Prolog (http://www.swi-prolog.org/), both versions 5.2.13 and 7.6.4. If you find any bug or want further information about this program, feel free to send me an e-mail.

The entry-point of the program is the file <i>myTalk.pl</i>: open it with SWI-Prolog or consult it from the current environment. Type the predicate <i>main_loop.</i>: the user interface is the same of the orginal Talk program.
